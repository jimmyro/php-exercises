# php-exercises

Various programs and exercises in PHP, from 2014.

"greensheet" was an attempt to switch my high school from paper-based course scheduling to an online tool, and got as far as reading courses from a catalog and inputting them into a database.

"kac-seating" was an attempt to automate the process of assigning students seats in my high school auditorium according to certain rules.

"tfa" was an attempt to create an online database for articles and letters in a student-run publication at my high school.

The remaining files are miscellaneous exercises in AJAX and interacting with databases.
