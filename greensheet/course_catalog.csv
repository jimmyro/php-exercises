The course begins with an intensive writing period, refreshing skills in description and narration while focusing on the students' place at Lawrenceville and in the greater community. We use modern and ancient stories to spur our thinking and discussion. Many sections study Antigone or one of the Platonic dialogues as vehicles through which we introduce and practice close reading and Harkness skills. Having deliberately outlined these skills, we move on to read the story of the Monkey King, The Ramayana, Homer's Odyssey, a Shakespeare play, Bible stories from the Old and the New Testaments, The Catcher in the Rye, and several shorter works. Reading focuses primarily on the Western tradition with some work connected to the freshman theater production in the winter and modern India in the spring. While much of the writing students do in this course focuses on forming an argument and using a text to support the steps of that argument, students also write for a variety of purposes, including to express themselves, to explore and come to understand complicated ideas, and to imitate stylistic and formal features of the authors they study. Working in tandem with Humanities Cultural Studies, Humanities English builds a foundation of skills and knowledge for the beginning student of the humanities. Grants: NCAA;   Terms: All;   Forms: II",all,II,,English,EN301,English III,"Readings in short fiction focus on the devices and tools of the short story writer (e.g., point of view, tone, setting, characterization) and let students study how these tools are deployed by a variety of nineteenth and twentieth century writers, including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Kate Chopin, and William Faulkner. Writing assignments ask students to craft a thesis statement and topic sentences that structure and organize their work. Students also work on discovering evidence and integrating it smoothly into their analytical prose. Students also have an opportunity to experiment with writing their own short fiction. Grammar lessons review the basic parts of speech, phrases, and clauses. At the end of the term, students read The Great Gatsby and write about their understanding of the novel's use of some of the tools of fiction they have studied. Grants: NCAA;   Terms: All;   Forms: III ",all,III,,English,EN421,The Novel,"This course builds upon English III by developing students’ skills at interpreting and contextualizing works of literature written in different genres.  The fall term is devoted to the study of long-form fiction. The reading materials include novels by a diverse range of authors from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Analytical writing continues to play a central role in the curriculum, with students composing analytical papers each of three novels. Discussion-based inquiry around the Harkness table encourages careful deliberation and constructive debate.

In the fall, students will write weekly personal essays, creative pieces, and some literary analyses; however, in the winter term, primary emphasis will be given to the development of the critical writing skills needed for college-level literature courses. Students who have demonstrated a clear proficiency in expository and critical writing in the fall may be permitted to enroll in other English electives in winter.

Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T2;   Forms: V",T2,V,,English,EN503,Fiction Seminar,"This course will focus on developing each student's fiction writing skills and his/her ability to help others write fiction. Various writing exercises and readings will also be done in class, and guest authors will read to the students. Outside of class, students will do assigned writing on their own, and each student will meet for individual conferences during which the teacher will offer ways of improving the student's writing. There will be no exam, but each student will be required to complete a manuscript of finished work. The student's finished work will be submitted to various contests and publications with the hope that the student will have some work published. There will also be a public reading at the end of the term when students will read from their own work. The course is limited to ten students. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1 or T2 or T3;   Forms: V","T1,T2,T3",V,,English,EN505,Style And Expression In Creative Writing,"Take this elective to balance the analytical side of your training. Identify your expressive voice and find out what it sounds like and what it looks like on paper. A series of graduated exercises trains you to manipulate increasingly demanding elements of dialogue, monologue, drama, autobiography, dream, poetry, and fiction. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1 or T2 or T3;   Forms: V","T1,T2,T3",V,,English,EN506,Literary Journalism,"It's a complex fate, being an American, wrote Henry James. This course will search for the American ethos through literary journalism across genres and disciplines. Discussions will focus on twentieth century essays, editorials, fiction, poetry, autobiography, and interviews. The class will trace the evolution of American political and literary thought through journalists, authors, and such public philosophers as H. L. Mencken, E. B. White, Walter Lippmann, Mark Twain, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sherwood Anderson, T. S. Eliot, Lillian Hellman, James Weldon Johnson, W. E. B. Dubois, Richard Wright, Robert Frost, and Edna St. Vincent Millay. We will examine the role of writers as outsiders and invaluable social critics and focus on the complex and fascinating relationship between truth and fiction. Students will learn not only how to do research and analyze across disciplines, but how to write definitive, journalistic research-based and critical literary magazine articles as well. Students will be responsible for writing and editing three literary magazines and writing and producing three television programs. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T2;   Forms: V",T2,V,,English,EN507,Literature Of National Pastime,"This course is designed to examine how the 20th century literature of our National Pastime affects and reflects American society. Through selected poems, essays, short stories, a novel, and an autobiography, we will explore how the mythic influence of baseball has shaped American culture. Ultimately the course will arrive at some conclusions supporting the assertion that baseball has had a unique grip on our national psyche. The vivid and unforgettable literature portrays the game's greatest heroes, how they were shaped by their times, and how their lives and legends reflect the changes in our society over the past hundred years. Writing requirements include several shorter essays and a final longer paper. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN508,African American Literature,"Students study the best works written by black American writers after the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s, with a primary emphasis on fiction and drama. The central concern of this course will be the efforts of black writers to explore artistically the conflicting claims of their racial and national identities and their perception of themselves as both apart from and a part of the American cultural scene. Readings include Richard Wright's Uncle Tom's Children, Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man, Toni Morrison's Beloved, and August Wilson's The Piano Lesson. Essays, stories and poems by James Baldwin, Zora Neale Hurston, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Robert Hayden will also be considered. Writing requirements include two short essays, a midterm, and a longer final paper. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN510,Literature Of The Beat Generation,"Jack Kerouac reputedly coined the term ""beat generation"" while meditating in a Catholic church on the hard life of his friends who had described themselves as ""beat"" by the culture in which they lived. They expressed dissatisfaction with a world that had embraced atomic weapons, the convenience of prepackaged foods, and ""the great eye"" of television that hypnotized Americans in every home. We will read the protest literature of Kerouac, Burroughs, Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti, Snyder, and others. Since Jazz rhythms and phrasing influenced much of the writing, good hepcats and kitties must listen to the music of Charlie Parker. Hipsters transformed into hippies, so we will also study counterculture poetry and prose. Students will demonstrate their understanding of the readings in two to three critical essays, numerous journal entries in the form of original poetry and prose, and one or two performance-based presentations. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN511,Asian American Literature,"This course is an introduction to Asian American literature. Throughout the term, we will cover a variety of texts ranging from well-known writers/poets such as Maxine Hong Kingston (The Woman Warrior), Jhumpa Lahari (Interpreter of Maladies), and Li-Young Lee (The City in Which I Love You) to some lesser known such as Theresa Cha (Dictee) and Carlos Bulosan (America Is in the Heart). As we navigate through the texts, we will attempt to answer the following questions: What does it mean to be Asian American? How does Asian American literature ""fit"" into and respond to the literary canon? What are the potential problems or benefits of having an all-encompassing category of ""Asian American"" literature? Finally, how does Asian American literature align with or distance itself from that of other marginalized groups? Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN512,Contemporary Women Writers,"In this course, we will read the work of a diverse group of artists writing in a variety of literary forms such as essays, novels, short stories, and possibly even poetry. The writers we will read may include Joan Didion, Marilynne Robinson, Toni Morrison, Louise Erdrich, Alice Munro, and Z.Z. Packer. That these writers are all women may or may not be significant, and much of the fun of the course will be in investigating what is possible, what is significant, and what intrigues us in the writing of women. The overarching questions we will discuss in this course are as follows: Do women writers share meaningful traits? Is ""women's writing"" simply a convenient catchall for female authorship? Do contemporary women writers have a shared mission? What is the duty of women writers today? Is it important to read works of literature written by women? Why or why not? What potential do these texts have to transform individual and communal opinions about which narratives are worthy of being told, written, read, and interpreted? How do these texts contend with common portrayals of women in canonical literature and cultural contexts?

Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN515,Springtime With The Puritans,"The little band of stiff-necked, well-educated, god-crazed, and sometimes hysterical religious dissenters who settled Salem (and much of New England) in the 1600s presents both a puzzle and a paradox dropped intriguingly at the doorstep of American history. Historian Richard Hofstader calls them ""the first class of American intellectuals."" Another historian, Perry Miller, argues that ""without some understanding of Puritanism at its source, there is no understanding of America."" In this elective we attempt to gain that modicum of understanding by reading a selection of Puritan diaries, poems, epitaphs, legal documents, and some sermons. We focus our attentions on the famous witch trials of the 1690s (transcripts), and then trace the Puritan fallout through three centuries of American culture. Several papers (one historical, one literary) are required, and students should be prepared to compose and deliver an original Puritan sermon. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN516,Essays Of Reflection,"Experience, said Aldous Huxley, ""is not what happens to a man; it is what a man does with what happens to him."" One of the central purposes of this course is to amplify the potential of key moments in your life to serve you as instructive experience. To that end, we will write (and write and write - an essay each week), first recollecting significant things that have happened to, in, and issuing from you, then re-membering them (literally, re-assembling their essential parts) so as to transform them from ephemeral occurrences into recognizable passages in a more carefully examined life. You will put pen to paper and fingers to keyboard in order, first, to discover yourself more deeply and, then, in order to try to explain yourself, in relation to your family, in relation to the places where you have lived and traveled, and in relation to school. One of this course's central intentions is to ensure, if you if you have not yet had time to sift through what happened in your freshman Humanities class or back at home over the summer or while you were doing Outward Bound, that you get a chance to consider and to communicate what that moment in your life was (and now is) about. However you have spent the past few years, this course intends, through rigorous writing, to help you to enunciate who, what and where you've been; who, what and where you are now; to what and where you might be going. Again, the essential course requirement is an essay each week.  Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN519,Southern African Literature,"In this course we will be studying literature by some of the most well-known writers of Southern Africa, beginning with Gillian Slovo's Red Dust, a fictional representation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's work in South Africa post-Apartheid. We will also move beyond the history of Apartheid and the boarders of South Africa, reading texts by South African writers J.M. Coetzee, Nadine Gordimer, Athol Fugard, Zakes Mda and Botswana author Bessie Head. Writing assignments will include several shorter essays and a final paper. Grants: Honors NCAA; Terms: T3; Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN523,Hemingway,"The reading in this course will include The Nick Adams Stories, A Farewell to Arms, The Sun Also Rises, and For Whom the Bell Tolls. Because Hemingway the man is as fascinating as Hemingway the writer, we will pay close attention to selected readings from the various biographies of Hemingway. Writing assignments will be varied and will include the opportunity to write in the style of Hemingway. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T2;   Forms: V",T2,V,,English,EN524,International Short Fiction,"Students read a selection of short stories (most in translation) from a variety of languages, cultures, and periods. Sometimes team-taught by members of the English and Language departments, the course explores the development of the contemporary short story as a product of a global evolution of the narrative process. Readings range from the Arabian Nights to Borges and include stories by Boccaccio, Tolstoy, Maupassant, Chekhov, Joyce, Poe, Lagerlof, Kafka, Lu Hsun, Mishima, Cheever, Garcia Marquez, and other authors. Students alternate in presenting background work on individual authors and leading discussions. Three papers and two presentations are required. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T2;   Forms: V",T2,V,,English,EN525,Irish Literature,"Courses 501 and 502 introduce new Fifth Form students to writing about personal experience and literature. In the fall, students will write weekly personal essays, creative pieces, and some literary analyses; however, in the winter term, primary emphasis will be given to the development of the critical writing skills needed for college-level literature courses. Students who have demonstrated a clear proficiency in expository and critical writing in the fall may be permitted to enroll in other English electives in winter. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN526,Journalism Seminar: Literature Of Fact,"Journalism offers a simple and straightforward approach to written expression. Anchored in observation and fact, journalistic writing applauds clarity and organization of content, and it offers a variety of stylistic modes ranging from hard news to opinion, criticism, and humor. An immediacy and relevance can be thrilling for students, and the theory of the press (focused as it is on the nature of fairness and objectivity) provides an important intellectual backdrop for all areas of communication. Readings may include selections from Thucydides, Montaigne, Defoe, Johnson, Poe, Crane, Whitman, Mencken, Hemingway, Agee, Mailer, Didion, Sheehan, Thompson, and Wolfe. The goal is to help students develop a personal style of their own. Students write each week-and rewrite-a variety of short pieces, many on subjects of their own choosing. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN528,Law As Literature,"This course is designed as a study of law as it appears in a variety of genres. We will study novels like Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Harry Mulisch's The Assault, and Albert Camus' The Fall, as well as dramas like The Andersonville Trial and Bolt's Man For All Seasons. The course also includes non-fiction works like Truman Capote's In Cold Blood and Wilkerson's An Act of Violence and numbers of court opinions and essays by writers ranging from Rebecca West to Oliver Wendall Holmes. Interviews with prosecutors, policemen, and judges are also planned, and students should expect to spend a day in court. Students write a major paper on each of the main works, usually four, and will also write weekly paragraph length essays on LSAT questions. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN530,Mark Twain,"Mark Twain, one of the best known figures in American culture during the 1800s, tried many different occupations, from riverboat pilot, to printer, to silver miner, to newspaper reporter, to soldier, to lecturer. We will examine his public life and his private life, reading short stories, newspaper stories, travelogues, essays, and novels as well as some biography and criticism. Writing assignments will be roughly six in number and vary from critical essays to personal essays to parodies of some of his pieces. A major project in the term will be to evaluate some of the criticism past and present in regard to his novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN531,Gender And Literature,"In this course, we will explore the politics of sex and gender identity. It is designed to introduce students to the frameworks that shape our thoughts about what it means to be a man/woman. We will read from a variety of texts including Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides, Orlando by Virginia Woolf, Gender Trouble by Judith Butler, and The History of Sexuality by Michel Foucault. Topics may include sexuality, feminism, and diversity in terms of race, ethnicity, age, and sexual orientation. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN532,Milton,"John Milton is generally considered one of the two or three most important authors in English, and his Paradise Lost is surely the most ambitious poem in the language. The principal work of the course will consist of a careful and complete reading of this epic, with emphasis on dramatic content and poetic technique. The course will begin with an examination of the poet's life and times and a detailed analysis of Lycidas. Samson Agonistes may be read if time permits. There will be several major papers, several in-class essays, and a test or two. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T2;   Forms: V",T2,V,,English,EN533,Moby Dick,"This course is devoted to an intensive reading of Herman Melville's Moby Dick (1851). Although it made Melville almost no money, selling fewer than 10,000 copies world-wide during the forty years between its publication and Melville's death in 1891, Moby Dick is now thought by many critics to be the most influential, if not the greatest, of American novels. Some of Melville's analogues and sources will be examined, and emphasis will be given to the historical and cultural issues informing the novel. Students will be required to keep a log, or journal, of their experiences and reactions as the Pequod sails round the world in search of the White Whale, and they will write two short essays and a longer final paper. As time permits, we will also consider Melville's writing career after Moby Dick by reading Bartleby the Scrivener and Billy Budd. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN535,Modern Irish Drama,"This course will explore and examine the lives and literature of some of Ireland's most prolific playwrights. With the founding of the Abbey Theatre in 1904 by W.B. Yeats, Lady Gregory, and J.M Synge, the stage was set for the Irish dramatist to emerge. Many playwrights surfaced using dramatic depictions to communicate the complexities of Ireland. A land of paradox, tension, rural life, and urban blight, Ireland continues to use drama as a vehicle for awareness, change, and progress. This course will study the works of Yeats, O'Casey, and Synge, as well as some contemporary dramatists. Students will write three comprehensive papers after reading the three major playwrights. Students should also expect some short in-class writing on specific scenes within the plays. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN536,Creative Non-Fiction,"Courses 501 and 502 introduce new Fifth Form students to writing about personal experience and literature. In the fall, students will write weekly personal essays, creative pieces, and some literary analyses; however, in the winter term, primary emphasis will be given to the development of the critical writing skills needed for college-level literature courses. Students who have demonstrated a clear proficiency in expository and critical writing in the fall may be permitted to enroll in other English electives in winter. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN537,Modern Thought And Literature,"We're not in Kansas anymore. Although Dorothy has to hitch a ride on a twister to get to the Technicolor strangeness of Oz, for many modern artists and writers, the world in which they lived seemed strange enough. Over the last century, revolutions in politics, technology, and society have assaulted the senses, defamiliarized the familiar, and challenged people to live with constant change. In their attempts to understand and represent the bewildering experience of living in the modern world, writers and artists experimented with new styles and literary forms, producing works that are absurd and disturbing, funny and fantastic, beautiful and challenging. The course aims to provide a survey of some of the major figures, texts, and ideas of the ""modernist"" period. Readings include Twilight of the Idols (Nietzsche), The Metamorphosis (Kafka), To the Lighthouse (Woolf), Waiting for Godot (Beckett) and selected short pieces by Gertrude Stein and Jorge Luis Borges. Students can expect to do two or three critical essays, a presentation, and a final project/paper. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN539,Patterns In The Short Story,"This course uses a wide variety of short stories to provide the student with the necessary tools to appreciate a demanding form of fiction. The hope is to give each student an understanding of the origins of the short story and also a recognition of some of the genre's recurring themes and patterns. Just a few of the many stories are Joyce's The Dead, Don DeLillo's Take the 'A' Train, and Lee K. Abbott's The Final Proof of Fate and Circumstance. The second half of the term will focus entirely on current short fiction, and we will also spend a week on science fiction. Students should expect to write four longer papers on particular areas of the short story, as well as a number of brief in-class essays on individual stories. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN540,Poetry Seminar,"In conjunction with the James Merrill poetry readings, Poetry Seminar gives students the opportunity to study and to converse with the distinguished poets who come to Lawrenceville each winter. In addition, the course offers students the chance to pursue their own writing in a variety of ways. Students typically write between eight and ten poems of their own over the course of the term, as well as a like number of critical essays on a variety of important poets. In addition, members of the class should anticipate reading their work to the class and also reading and editing the work of their colleagues. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T2;   Forms: V",T2,V,,English,EN542,Southern Literature,"The South is the one part of this country to have suffered unambiguous defeat; and that defeat not only colors its actions and attitudes but also inspires its song and its ironic and spirit-soaked and in some ways (even when comic) rather sad fiction. The victors in a war may assume the right to compose the history of the conflict, but often the losers write the enduring fiction-and thus win that other and unending battle that takes place in the human heart. We'll read works by the likes of Eudora Welty, Ernest J. Gaines, Flannery O'Connor, Richard Wright, Peter Taylor, Carson McCullers and, above all, William Faulkner. We'll read them in part to see the effects of that external war the South lost, but mostly to discover how well the South has reversed that historical judgment or redeemed itself through art. Papers after every major text and some in-class essays are required. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN543,Temptation Of Power,"Stalin said cynically that one death is a tragedy, a million deaths only a statistic. Someone else said that you've got to break eggs to make an omelet. Between them they define the temptation at the core of modern politics: the power that knowledge, organization, masses of men, and machines offer to politicians, and especially visionary politicians, in our time. Such power is a central theme in modern literature and the theme of this course. We start with Machiavelli's The Prince and Shakespeare's Measure for Measure to set up the arguments, and then move on to short readings from Dostoevsky, Conrad, and Kafka. For novels, lately we've read Arthur Koestler's Darkness at Noon, George Orwell's Animal Farm, Harry Mulisch's The Assault, and Elie Wiesel's Night and Dawn, but we've read other novels in the past (e.g., Fahrenheit 451 and A Clockwork Orange), and we might well read new things in the future. Students will write a paper for Machiavelli/Shakespeare and for each major novel, with some in-class writing spaced throughout. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN544,Shakespeare's Comedies: Masks We Wear,"This elective looks closely at three very different comedies (Twelfth Night, The Merchant of Venice, and Much Ado About Nothing) focusing on the motifs of disguise and deceit in each as well as the question of what constitutes a comedy. All of the plays involve both physical and figurative masks, and each raises questions about the morality of hiding one's true identity behind a false front. Video versions of each of the plays supplement the texts, and if we have an opportunity to see a live show in the area, we will take advantage of that. In addition, a little time at the very start of the term will be dedicated to writing personal essays to give seniors the opportunity to do some work on their college applications. Students will write two personal essays and three analytical essays over the course of the term. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN546,Colonialism In Literature,"Modern citizens of the Western world have long tended to assume that the rest of the world shares-or needs only to see to embrace-our tolerant view of things and our pragmatic faith in free markets, free travel, free speech. We assume likewise that ""Old World"" forces like tradition, place, and blood no longer operate upon or within us, and, therefore, that we are at home everywhere. In this course, we will read some stories about what happens when such assumptions are put to the test, when a Westerner goes east or south-anywhere where he is a stranger, an alien, not one of ""the people."" Assignments will include some in-class writing and a major essay on each novel. Recent readings include Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, E. M. Forster's A Passage to India, Chinua Achebe's No Longer at Ease, Graham Greene's The Quiet American, and V. S. Naipaul's In a Free State. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN547,The Screwball Comedy and its Critics,"Courses 501 and 502 introduce new Fifth Form students to writing about personal experience and literature. In the fall, students will write weekly personal essays, creative pieces, and some literary analyses; however, in the winter term, primary emphasis will be given to the development of the critical writing skills needed for college-level literature courses. Students who have demonstrated a clear proficiency in expository and critical writing in the fall may be permitted to enroll in other English electives in winter. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN548,West Of Everything,"This course is designed as a study of the West of the American imagination and includes novels like Ron Hansen's Desperadoes, Cormac McCarthy's All The Pretty Horses and Blood Meridian, and Michael Ondaatje's The Collected Works of Billy the Kid; short stories by Stephen Crane, Richard Ford, and Lee Abbott; and non-fiction like Allen Barra's Inventing Wyatt Earp and Jonathan Raban's Bad Land. We will also see a number of films, ranging from John Wayne's Rio Grande to Tombstone and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. Students should expect to write a major paper on each of the novels, as well as brief essays on the films. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN551,Signifying Nothing: Experimental Novels,"What is real? What is true? Whose version of experience do we trust? How reliable is memory as a record of the past and a resource for understanding? How does language represent-distort-create-the world of our experience? In this course we will look at three novels (William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Chronicle of a Death Foretold, Nicole Krauss' recent novel, The History of Love (2005)) that attempt to make sense of people and events that apparently defy logic or understanding. While all three novels tell compelling, gripping stories-of a family in the American South, of the Holocaust, of a murder in a small South American village-they also force us to think about the nature of time and history and the vagaries of human memory. Students can expect to do two or three critical papers, a presentation, and a final project/paper. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN553,Trauma And The Literary Imagination,"Poetry makes nothing happen; the efficacy of poetry is nil-no lyric has ever stopped a tank, wrote W. H. Auden when faced with the brutalities of history. Harold Bloom said that ""we have no warrant for imagination in the most terrible of areas."" Seamus Heaney argued that ""the redressing effect of poetry comes from its being a glimpsed alternative, a revelation of potential that is denied or constantly threatened by circumstances."" As a class, we'll evaluate these conclusions by asking anew what is to be gained by writing about trauma. And what is to be gained by reading it? What access do we have to it if we read about it as literature, instead of through the lens of some other discipline? This course aims to explore literature about trauma in order to understand both trauma and the potentials and purposes of answering questions that we'll devise as a class throughout the term. We'll look at world wars and what comes afterwards, epidemics and personal traumas. We'll study literature written by victims, by proxy-witnesses, by fiction writers, poets, documentarians, and feature-filmmakers, as well as texts written by psychiatrists, philosophers, and literary critics. Students will reflect often on the readings and films, will write and peer-review several analytical essays and will revise one of their papers as they gain familiarity with our subjects and arrive at a more sophisticated understanding of them. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN554,Chaucer: Text and Context,"Courses 501 and 502 introduce new Fifth Form students to writing about personal experience and literature. In the fall, students will write weekly personal essays, creative pieces, and some literary analyses; however, in the winter term, primary emphasis will be given to the development of the critical writing skills needed for college-level literature courses. Students who have demonstrated a clear proficiency in expository and critical writing in the fall may be permitted to enroll in other English electives in winter. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN555,Boarding School Literature,"Boarding schools and their surrounding settings and situations have become a familiar literary genre from Salinger's classic Catcher in the Rye to Sittenfeld's more recently published Prep. This course would survey various types of boarding school literature"" with the goal of examining the culture of boarding schools, the ways in which the culture is portrayed or distorted in various works, and the particular conventions of this genre of literature. Readings may include Tobias Wolff's Old School, John Knowles' A Separate Peace, Prep, Canin's The Palace Thief, and All Loves Excelling, a novel written by former Lawrenceville headmaster Josiah Bunting. Writing assignments will include reader responses, personal narratives, and literary analysis. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN556,Modern English Plays,"It has been said that the world has never seen a greater period of change than the 20th century, and the modern stage has artfully reflected the confusion and excitement of that time. In the first half of the century, England was involved in two World Wars, the sobering effects of which can be clearly seen on the British stage. The snobbery and waste of the upper classes that was once a great source for comedy was now a more appropriate theme for tragedy, and humor found itself rooted in the existentialist idea of absurdity itself. This elective will look closely at this change in the theater through three playwrights: one from the late 1800s, and two from the middle and late 20th century. We will read six plays over the term and write an essay on each of the three authors. The class itself will be text and discussion based, but it will also include films and our own oral interpretations of the plays around the Harkness table. Texts may include: Wilde's The Importance of Being Ernest and An Ideal Husband, J.B. Priestly's An Inspector Calls and Time and the Conways, and Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead and The Real Inspector Hound. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN557,Multicultural American Fiction,"This course will explore works of literature written by African-American, Arab-American, Asian-American, and Latina/o authors.  We will begin by asking whether the writings of such authors are distinguished by particular thematic, formal, and stylistic features.  In what ways has the field of American literature been shaped by ""culturally specific"" heritages and perspectives?  We will then track the shift from ""roots"" to ""routes"" that has been diagnosed in recent immigrant and transnational writing.  How are today’s increasingly mobile writers transforming the settings, characters, and plots of the novel?  How do they construe the impact of the global on the local?  And what might their writings forecast about the future of American fiction?  Over the course of the term, we will read and discuss novels and short stories written by the following authors: Lan Cao, Sandra Cisneros, Edwidge Danticat, Junot Díaz, Yussef El Guindi, Gish Jen, Jhumpa Lahiri, Mohja Kahf, Toni Morrison, Luis J. Rodriguez, Helena María Viramontes, John Edgar Wideman, and Karen Tei Yamashita. Grants: Honors;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN558,Utopian Imagination in Literature & Film,"When Thomas More envisioned an ideal society in his novel Utopia (1516), he coined a word whose Greek roots could mean both the ""good place"" (eu-topos) and ""no place"" (ou-topos). Such linguistic ambiguity was meant to suggest that a perfect society might also be an unattainable society: a nowhere land. If More knew that his ideal society might never be realized, why would he bother to imagine it? How might the lands of the imagination exert an influence on reality? This course will introduce students to the thematic, formal, and practical dimensions of utopian literature from the British and American traditions. After grounding ourselves in a classical utopian text like Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Blithedale Romance (1852) or William Morris's News From Nowhere (1890), we will survey the wide variety of utopian subgenres that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During the modern era, utopian fiction became a privileged site for exploring a host of questions related to human nature, social organization, and historical change. Are humans naturally individualistic or naturally collaborative? What kind of society would enable us to become our best selves? And how might we transform an imperfect world into a (more) perfect one? Additional texts may include one or two of the following: a feminist utopian novel (such as Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale or Marge Piercy's Woman on the Edge of Time), an Afro-futurist novel (like Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower or Nalo Hopkinson'sReport from Planet Midnight), or an ecotopian manifesto (like Ernest Callenbach's Ecotopia or Peter Lamborn Wilson's Avant Gardening). Along the way, we will also watch a few utopian and dystopian films (such as Frank Capra's Lost Horizon and Ridley Scott's Blade Runner). Grants: Honors;   Terms: T2;   Forms: V",T2,V,,English,EN559,The Graphic Novel,"The graphic novel is an aesthetically innovative genre in which meaning is created through the interplay of image and text. How do we read a novel in which two narrative channels - one verbal, the other visual - interact? What can this multi-modal genre do that other literary genres cannot? And how might it challenge readers to expand the set of interpretive techniques that make up ""close reading""? This course will investigate the renaissance of graphic narrative that has taken place in the last 25 years. Students who are thinking about enrolling should be aware that we will not be taking upthe superhero and science-fiction traditions of long-form comics. Instead, we will pursue a more recent tradition of graphic narrative that grapples with pressing social and political issues, ranging from the Holocaust (Maus) and the Iranian Revolution (Persepolis) to sexuality (Fun Home) and disability (Building Stories). How might the form of the graphic novel be particularly well-suited for grappling with such topics? And how have graphic novelists employed the formal components of the genre - panel frames, gutters, bleeds, splash pages, motion lines, and so on - to create meaning within individual works? Primary texts will include Art Spiegelman’s Maus: A Survivor’s Tale (1986/1991), Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis (2003/2004), Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home (2006), and Chris Ware’s Building Stories (2012). Grants: Honors;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN560,Public and Private:Writers As Diarists,"Since 1919, when Bruce Frederick Cummings published a selection from his own diary as The Journal of a Disappointed Man, there has been a precedent for writing diaries and journals in order to get into print. But what about those writers and artists for whom diaries or journals were a second(ary) genre, and whose aim was not to publish them? In ""Deliberation,"" Barthes describes his diary-keeping as a ""disease,"" because he could not help but doubt the value of the activity, and he always finds himself ""posing."" But while Barthes deliberated, such diarists as Woolf, Gide, Kafka, Sexton, Plath, Rorem, and Mansfield (quite a disordered list) pressed on. What is the value of working in these ""private"" genres when the popular faith in these forms as veridical is overcome by an awareness of artifice in one's self-presentation? Is this awareness inevitable for modernist diarists and journal writers, particularly when they also work in another more deliberately audience oriented genre? This course will explore what writers' diaries and journals may signify. What are the selves of the journals and diaries in relation to the selves we find in more formal or public works? What is the relationship between the published work and the diary work? The course will likely have a creative writing or at least diary component for us to play with in some form, in addition to working in a more traditionally analytical mode. Grants: Honors NCAA;   Terms: T2;   Forms: V",T2,V,,English,EN563,The New York School of Poets,"In this course, we will practice the art of close reading in the context of a particular group of modern and contemporary poets. Frank O'Hara, John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, and James Schuyler lived and wrote as part of a larger group of friends, writers, and visual artists in New York City beginning in the 1950s and 1960s-a group that included the painters Willem de Kooning, Robert Rauschenberg, Fairfield Porter, and Jackson Pollock. Inspired by French surrealism, these four poets often concerned themselves with the urban modernism flourishing in New York at the time, and they were deeply interested in the relationship between poetry and the visual arts. Early in the course we will spend time examining some of the concurrent visual art, as well as acquainting (or reacquainting) ourselves with poetic terminology relevant to analysis. We will move through a selection of poetry from each poet with the aim of immersing ourselves in their languages and discussing how we might characterize this ""movement."" Grants: Honors;   Terms: T3;   Forms: V",T3,V,,English,EN564,Mystery of Language: Detective Fiction,"In this course, we will examine the tradition, the dynamic nature, and the attraction of Detective Novels. In addition to reading the first mystery writers, students will read short stories and novels covering the tradition and genre. We will explore the question of what distinguishes detective fiction from other works of fiction, the development of the detective as an archetypal hero, and what makes this genre so popular. Possible readings include: Edgar Allan Poe, Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler, and Robert B. Parker. In addition to viewing some of the following films: The Maltese Falcon, Chinatown, The Postman Always Rings Twice, A Thief of Time, and Blade Runner. Grants: Honors;   Terms: T2;   Forms: V",T2,V,,English,EN565,War Stories,"War, said Margaret Atwood, is what happens when language fails. Or when the fiery rhetoric of a demagogue succeeds. Or honor trumps reason. Or reason trumps fear. Like marriage, it is not something to be ""entered into unadvisedly or lightly,"" for either a society or a soldier. Time, then, to gather more perspective through literature.  As a sophomore you read about Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, who, having joined ROTC to get a college education, ends up with a combat command for which he is tragically ill-equipped. Onward, now, into texts such as: Kevin Powers’s The Yellow Birds, which gives us an updated experience of the US Army grunt in and after the US’s second Iraq war; E.L. Doctorow’s Civil War novel, The March, about the vicious Union advance through Georgia led by General William Tecumseh Sherman in late 1864 (the summer reading); Pat Barker’s Regeneration, which brings the World War I poets Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves and Wilfred Owen back to life; and Michael Ondaatje’s novel of World War II, The English Patient, which helps us to imagine, among other experiences, what it’s like to nurse-and to be-a broken person. Course requirements include close reading, active co-leadership of class discussions, three essays and a final paper. Grants: Honors;   Terms: T1;   Forms: V",T1,V,,English,EN566,Versions of Lear,"The worst is not, / So long as we can say, 'This is the worst' (IV.i.28). So says the protagonist of the most devastating of Shakespeare's tragedies, King Lear. This, however, will not be a Shakespeare course. Indeed, the misfortune Lear suffers at the hands of his own children (and his own foolishness) has been the source for several adaptations of which Shakespeare's play is only one. Instead, this seminar may be best understood as a methodologies course that aims to give students a sense of literary authority over a legend that has captivated people across the globe for centuries. We will strive for mastery of this legend by reading and discussing Shakespeare's King Lear, pre-21st century commentary on the play, and several 20th century adaptations in both literature and film. These adaptations include Akira Kurasowa's critically acclaimed film, Ran; Jane Smiley's Pulitzer Prize winning novel, A Thousand Acres; and Gareth Hind's graceful graphic novel, King Lear. Questions we will consider include: What is so compelling about this myth that would lead the great Romantic essayist William Hazlitt to say, ""The passion which [Shakespeare] has taken for his subject is that which strikes its root deepest into the human heart""? Can we make a similar statement about Kurasowa or Smiley's respective treatments of the legend? More generally, how do artists adopt plots and themes from other artists and situate them in novel historical and cultural contexts? Is there an emotional or intellectual unity that connects these texts? What aspects of the human condition does the legend of Lear illuminate? In the best of literature classes we learn not simply from our peers and our teachers, but also from the texts we read, debate, and strive to master. Like the misfortunes of Lear, the nuggets of wisdom and insights into the logic of human passions his narrative offers seem unending. In this course, not only we will encounter Shakespeare, Kurosawa, Smiley, and Hind's versions of Lear, but we will also conceive of and encounter our own.

Rather than spend the term on only two or three longer works, students will read shorter works and excerpts from longer works, so as to expose them to the incredibly wild and wonderful variety of avant garde writing that is being done today. Works such as Anne Carson's Nox, Brian Selznick's The Invention of Hugo Cabret, R.M. Berry's Avant-Garde and the Question of Literature, Craig Thompson's Blankets, Jonathan Lethem's story Lostronaut in the New Yorker, works of Mark Danielewski, Shelley Jackson, Carole Maso, Lynda Barry, Tao Lin, Deb Olin Unferth, Amelia Gray, Cecilia Vicuna, and the like.

Students will write roughly a poem a week, which they will share with the rest of the class in a workshop setting, offering and receiving constructive critique. Students can expect to write a variety of different kinds of poems, as well as two pieces of analytical/critical writing: a review of a book by a contemporary poet and an analytical ""Introduction"" to an imaginary volume of Selected Poems by a second poet. While the department recommends that students take a variety of electives-writing vs. literature, different genres, periods, and themes-students may take both Poetry Seminar in the winter and Poetry Workshop in the spring.

In the process, students examine the reasons why societies evolve as they do, and scrutinize the historical roots of current conflicts and controversies. An equally important objective of the course is to hone the skills historians use to make meaning of the past. Students learn to read primary and secondary texts strategically and critically; ask great questions; research honestly and effectively; and analyze, construct and present compelling arguments on paper and at the Harkness table.

Politically pragmatic at the most common level, he put principle above all else when it counted most. Widely disparaged and reviled at the peak of his political career, he became in death a national hero. This course uses primary sources-Lincoln's own letters, speeches and reflections-in an attempt to extract the man from the myths that have encrusted him, and to examine the role of both man and myth in American history.

It is less a history of the Vietnam War than a history of how the press covered it. Journalists often claim that their work is the first rough draft of history. In Vietnam, their work-both in print and on television-was controversial and influential. Students in this course will study that work in order to address questions such as: Was the press a spectator, or did it become part of the drama? Did journalists capture history's first rough draft, or did they leave behind a record that is ultimately tainted? Did the correspondents do what was right, and if so, right for whom? Were they professionals, or were they subversives? If their work was not the first rough draft of history, then what was it? Did the press ""lose"" Vietnam?

On a more broad front the course seeks to educate students on both the principles of the American legal system and the ways those principles are expressed during the course of an actual litigation. The course will take up differences between civil and criminal litigation; the rules of direct vs. cross-examination; and the definitions of various rules of evidence like hearsay. What, for instance, is its definition, and what might be considered exceptions to that rule? Students should expect to read extensively and closely the details of an individual case and to write a number of openings, closings, and witness statements. They will also be expected to master the rules of courtroom procedure and to engage in extensive role-playing.

Do emotions reside in the body or in the mind? Which aspects of our emotional experience are universal, and which are culturally specific? This interdisciplinary course draws upon insights and methodologies from the core disciplines of English, history, and science. During each week of the term, we will explore recent breakthroughs that researchers across those three disciplines have generated about particular emotions: hope, laughter, fear, love, surprise, disgust, and so on. First, we will examine recent insights into emotion generated by neuroscientists and evolutionary biologists. Do emotions have an evolutionary purpose? Do people control their moods and passions, or do people’s moods and passions control them? Second, we will explore what historians have revealed about the role that emotions play in people’s social and political lives. How have norms related to the expression of emotion changed in recent years? Which emotions are most important in modern democracies? Third, we will examine how literary fictions are able to generate emotion in readers. How are fictional texts able to ""move"" readers emotionally? And how can fictional texts move people to take action within the real world?

At the turn of the century, many poets and playwrights looked around them at a world in crisis: war loomed over Europe, and the established order offered no solace. Feelings of despair and alienation prevailed. Life seemed meaningless and absurd. This course will explore the evolution of existentialism, with emphasis on seminal works of prose and drama by such authors as Dostoyevsky, Sartre, Beckett, Camus, and Kafka, as well as essays by Kierkegaard, Buber, and Sartre. As we continue to read, discuss, and grow our understanding of philosophical tenets, students will explore the advantages of allowing for permeable boundaries between the disciplines of English and philosophy. The course's essential questions are designed to tie these two disciplines together so we do not forget that literature invites itself to be used as a mirror of our experience-it's the very nature of the genre to be self-reflective. As Camus reminds us, ""If the world were clear, art would not exist"". Students will demonstrate their understanding of the readings in critical writing, creative writing, seminar, and performance-based pieces followed by a lively question-and-answer session.

Both plays end in an uneasy sense of comedy, an edgy feeling that the happy ending has some dark underpinning that audiences cannot and should not overlook. Though not officially designated as a member of this trio, The Taming of the Shrew offers similar feelings of discomfort. The problem plays in general concern themselves with the difference between seeming and being and with identities that have been masked in various forms of trickery and deception. All involve much morally murky ground for their characters. In addition, scholars point out puzzling questions of authorship in these plays: were they revised by Shakespeare's contemporaries or ""borrowed"" from other contemporary dramatists? Students will engage in an interdisciplinary investigation into how issues of performance can extend and clarify understandings derived from literary analysis. Students will demonstrate their understandings of the plays in critical essays, one or two recitation pieces, production plans, and a performance-based final exam.

How can we combine our historical and literary inquiries to produce robust understandings of world cultures?  What room is left for individual genius?  This year-long course uses history to inform literary interpretation and literature to enrich our understanding of specific times and places.  In a strategically linked English and History curriculum, students will develop the reading, writing, and thinking skills essential for strong disciplinary thinking while learning to first differentiate and then integrate the disciplines, creating interpretations unavailable to History or English alone, all while gaining skills in aesthetic appreciation and cultural understanding.

We begin with an examination of Samuel Johnson's production of the 1755 Dictionary of the English Language. We then read selected chapters from a standard linguistics textbook followed by a careful examination of classic essays by language theorists like Ferdinand de Saussure, Charles Sanders Peirce, and Roman Jakobson, then modern investigators such as Noam Chomsky, John Searle, Gerald Edelman, Derek Bickerton, Terrance W.

All work takes place during class. There are no out-of-class assignments. Each week is a separate unit organized around a key concept. Freud's theory of the unconscious mind, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, Natural Law as envisioned by Thomas Aquinas, Coleridge's notion of the ""willing suspension of disbelief,"" Jack Kerouac's vision of a global felahim, ""degeneration"" in immunology, or homeostasis as defined by Claude Bernard are all possible examples. These concepts are powerful gears within their own disciplines, and generally prized as the truffles in the candy box of thought. But can they be usefully applied to problems beyond the boundaries of their native discipline? We will select ten, gain a rich, non-trivial understanding of one of these early each week, explore its uses and implications mid-week, and close the week by attempting individually to discover a novel application for the concept beyond the confines of its home court.

Poverty in the Developing World is a two trimester course that examines the historic, economic, and cultural roots as well as the impact of poverty in the developing world. In particular we will try to understand how poverty impacts women and families. We will study many of the different approaches taken to alleviating poverty—from big aid programs to microfinance and more, looking at the strengths and weaknesses of each and the lessons we can learn along the way. The course will then turn to poverty in the US and especially Mercer County, exploring how local issues are similar or different from those studied in the developing world.   As part of this section of the course we will engage in service learning in Trenton during our extended block and during other significant out-of-class experiences.   In turn, this service will deeply inform our understanding of poverty and the poor communities throughout the world. The course will culminate in students devising a plan of action for addressing a specific aspect of poverty in the world and may lead to a trip to Tanzania to plan and build a school and/or a trip to India over spring break.

Salinger, who explored some possible modes of behavior in response to the Freudian predicament. We then turn to the libidinous Beats (Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, and William Burroughs) who reshaped the project into the apocalyptic postures that were politicized in the 60s, commercialized and/or pastoralized in the 70s, romanticized in the 80s, then detoxed and archived on t-shirts for our own new century.
